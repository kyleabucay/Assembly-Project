# Assembly Solo Project

This project is a creative twist on the classic "Hangman" game. Instead of guessing random words, each incorrect guess crosses out an online game from a list.

# Key Features:

    Timer – Adds a challenging time limit to the game.

    Accessibility – Players can start and play the game entirely using the keyboard (e.g., pressing Enter or typing answers).

    Random Status Messages – A unique message is shown for each incorrect guess.

    Game Over Feedback – Displays the correct word if the user runs out of chances.

    Win Celebration – Triggers a confetti animation when the user wins.
